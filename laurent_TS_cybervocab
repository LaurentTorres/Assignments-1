Phishy story
"Hello?" the phone stopped ringing. In Oliver's house there was a really small telphone. Even though things were small they were
still modern. You could say that everything in there was really expensive. He had a really good job, and was paid really well. He was so 
innocent, he didn't believe anything bad could happen to him. He used to think that money could do it all, that it could protect him. He
didn't believe that money could be used against him.
"Whose this?" Oliver asked
"This is Mario, I work in the American Bank were you have your money saved, we were informed that your acount was hacked. But to verify that
we will need your credit card number. Could you please give it to us so we can solve this issue?" The voice in the other end didn' sound 
suspicions at all, he was calm, unlike Oliver.
"Hacked? I can't believe someone stole my money! I thought this bank was secure, but now... I can't believe this!! Okay, you need to solve
this NOW. The credit card number is 8742014383. Use is and solve this.
"Thank you Sir. You don't have to worry anymore. Your money issue will be solved." 
Oliver was so worried now, he didn't even realize what he had just done. When he told his wife he was so frustrated. He started screaming 
in anger. But what his wife said next made it all stop.
"Honey, you gave your credit card numer to someone you don't know. If you hadn't been hacked before, you will be now. How didn't you 
realize what it meant?
1 week later Oliver's account was empty. Phishing like this is really common because sometimes it can sound so innocent. Giving your 
personal info isn't right or smart. Be smart, don't get cought.
